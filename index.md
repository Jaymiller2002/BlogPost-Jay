# Jay's Blog:

## Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
It was more than I expected to be honest mainly cause all I've been working with before was HTML, CSS and a little Javascript. Being introduced to git, github and gitpod has honestly been really confusing and getting them to connect/work together just hasn't been working for me.

## What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
I'm eager to get a better understanding of how git, gitpod, github and vscode work together to properly make things function correctly.

## What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
My name is Jay Miller, I am 21 years old and live in Lexington, KY. Two things you'll learn about me from reading this blog post are that I love to play basketball and video games.
