## What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?
I find it extremely cool to see everything finally come together to make a fully functional page or website.
## What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?
pusedocoding is SUPER helpful and I need to get better at it. I need to also work on organizing my pusedocode.
## What was helpful during Onboarding that made working remotely easier?
I'd say the help channel on slack because usually I would be able to look through and see someone else having the same problem or just ask for help in the channel myself.
## What hindered your progress during Onboarding?
Just my own personal life(family, time-management, sleep, etc)
## How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?
I overcame challenges through perseverance and by asking for help. I may have taken to long to ask for help so I'll do that sooner next week. 
## What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
Javascript because it's a whole new language for me so I just need to slow down a bit so I can understand what i'm doing.
## What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?
I'd love to learn more about javascript and how to change anything in html
# What is your “Why”?
I'd like to learn this since javascript is so powerful and there's a lot you can accomplish with it.
